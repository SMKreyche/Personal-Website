I am a planetary scientist at the University of Idaho. Primarily, I study the rotational dynamics of planetary bodies in the context of habitability. My other research interests include planetary atmospheres, stellar occultations, and exoplanets in general. I am currently seeking a postdoctoral position to further my scientific research career.

During my time off I enjoy a variety of hobbies such as playing board games, mountain biking, and camping in the great outdoors.
